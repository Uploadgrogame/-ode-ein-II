Silent Aimbot, ESP/Wallhack (Lost/enemies/NPCs/loot/vestiges/hidden paths/blood altars/queen fragments), No Recoil, Radar, Infinite Health/Ichor/Blood Gauge/Drain Meter, Speedhack, Fly, Noclip, One-Hit Kill, Auto-Parry, Auto-Dodge, Auto-Buff, Auto-Collect Loot, Auto-Quest Complete, Instant Blood Code Unlock, Weapon/Vestige Switcher, Companion God Mode, Infinite Gift Usage, Streamproof & more 💀

Standalone .exe — no injector needed, run as admin and drain your first blood code.  
Works on latest Code Vein II (v1.02–v1.05 patches, Bandai Namco / Shift AC active).  
Status: Undetected low-key/closet (community tested on PC, HWID spoof — rage/AC waves ban fast if overused in co-op/online modes) 🟢🟠

Why this hack survives custom AC in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Code Vein II → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes, preserves anime souls-like feel  
- Kernel AC bypass — streamproof overlays, no server-side checks triggered, compatible with all DLCs (expected 2026 expansions with new blood codes, companions, weapons, vestiges, new Gaol regions)  
- ESP: enemies (Lost variants, Successors, Queens, Revenant hunters, mutated bosses, elite enemies), NPCs (companions, Io, Cruz, Louis, Yakumo, Mia, Jack, Eva, Karen, Coco, Davis, Gustav, Aurora, Rin), loot crates, vestiges, blood codes, hidden paths, ambushes, guard patrols, collectibles (Queen fragments, Mistle, Depths keys, blood beads, memories, weapons, armor), weak points on bosses (cores, hearts, glowing spots, broken masks) highlighted  
- Updates post-DLC/patch (new blood codes like "Eclipse" or "Abyss", new companions, new areas like deeper Gaol layers, new gifts, new boss variants)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / Bandai Namco Launcher)
